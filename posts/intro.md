here lies meditations of a web developer trying to live a life
of learning, teaching, and building tech solutions
with JavaScript, React, and all things UI/UX until he
either finds himself on a senior front-end or even a full-stack role, 
or finally finishes his undergrad thesis,
or is about to deploy the next killer app for pinoys.
he is writing fiction too, and promises to not die without making a single movie.

as long as no thesis is done, no app deployed, no movie made, or no story is published, he will be here, dreaming.
